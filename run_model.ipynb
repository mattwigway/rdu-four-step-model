There are different models by trip type (Home-Based Work, Home-Based Other, and Non-Home-Based) and time period (AM Peak, midday, PM Peak, overnight); to give you an idea of what these models look like, we print out two of them before we run the trip generation function.\n",

        "Since there are no other other features on this map, it's a bit hard to read, but by comparing with other maps of the region you can clearly see that the highest densities of trips are generated by the three major cities: Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, with lower densities generated by suburban areas and the lowest densities by rural areas.\n",

        "\n",
        "After the trip generation step, we have the number of trips produces in each zone and attracted to each zone, but we don't know which trips from zone A go to zone B. That is the job of the trip distribution step. In this model, a gravity function is used to distribute trips; trips are more likely to go to destinations with higher attractiveness, but less likely to go to destinations far away. How far away is controlled by the power in the gravity function. Since people may be willing to travel different amounts for different purposes, we estimate separate powers for each of our three trip types. The powers are shown below:\n",

Feel free to experiment with changing the origin tract to where you live, or anywhere else.

        "We have now forecasted how many trips will flow between each pair of tracts, by type and time period. However, we don't know what mode they will use. This is the function of the mode choice model. This model actually has two mode choice models—one for home-based work/other trips and one for non-home-based trips. The reason for this is that the home-based trip model can use information about the home location to improve the model fit. Here is the mode choice model for non-home-based trips.\n",

        "The last step is to assign the auto trips to the network. Right now, we have forecasted origins, destinations, and modes, but we don't know what roads they use. Often, the two model outputs with the most significant policy implications are congestion levels and emissions. Both require network assignment. Evaluating emissions is beyond the scope of this lesson (if you're interested, check out the [EPA MOVES](https://www.epa.gov/moves) model), but we will model congestion.\n",

        "This model uses an iterative network assignment process known as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Running the cell below will assign the forecasted PM Peak trips to the network. This is the most computationally intensive part of the process; it will probably take about 5–10 minutes. As the model runs, it will print out its progress using a metric known as \"relative gap\"—when it falls below 0.01, the model is finished (this metric is not something you need to remember or know the definition of, but just a tip so you can get a sense of how much longer you have to wait).\n",
